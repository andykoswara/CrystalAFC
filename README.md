# CrystalAFC
MATLAB codes to simulate anti-fouling control of plug-flow crystallization via heating and cooling cycle as described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.08.180 and https://doi.org/10.1109/LLS.2017.2661981

Specifically, the codes solve a set of partial differential equations that describes a crystallization and encrustation process in a plug flow:
